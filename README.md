## The Broomstick
The broom is a weekly meeting of people who like to explore new ideas and work on projects together, with the intention of self improvement and spreading knowledge.

The broom is open ended, but encourages intellectually stimulating conversation. Also the broom hates bureaucracy, so all members have equal say on admins trivia.

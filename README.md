# The Broom!

This is a wiki for documenting cool ideas. And stuff.

## The Broomstick
So wtf is the broom?!?!

The broom is a weekly meeting of people who like to learn about new ideas and work on projects together, with the intention of self improvement and spreading knowledge.

The broom is open ended, but we try to keep conversations intellectually stimulating. It's also decentralized, so all members have equal say on admins trivia.
